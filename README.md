# Evaluation Framework for Spanish Medical Applications of Large Language Models

## Overview
This repository contains all relevant documentation and code for the Master's Thesis by **Alberto Ramón Mélida Asensio** at **Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR)**. The thesis focuses on evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for **medical applications in Spanish**, particularly through an automated pipeline using **MIR exam questions**.

## Contents
- **SUMMARY.md**: Overview of the research, methodology, and key findings.
- **CODE/**: Python scripts for running the evaluation pipeline.
- **DATA/**: Dataset used for the evaluation (if applicable).
- **RESULTS/**: Evaluation results from different models.
- **REFERENCES.md**: Bibliography and citations.
- **LICENSE.md**: Licensing information for this project.
